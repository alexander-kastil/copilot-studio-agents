# Module & TOC Conception

The information architecture of a course: how the modules and topics are named, ordered, sized,
and surfaced in the master table of contents. This is the conception layer above `scaffold`
(which creates folders) and `create-teaching` (which fills a module README). Reach for it before
scaffolding a new class and whenever restructuring an existing one.

## The master TOC format is a contract

The master TOC (the module list in `demos/readme.md`) is a module heading followed by a `ul` of
BARE keyword links, one per topic. Do not add per-bullet descriptions, a `- ... - prose` suffix,
or any text after the link. Descriptions belong in the module README's topic table, never in the
master TOC. Never change this format; the author's TOC shape is deliberate.

## Titles must earn attendance

Every topic and module title has to make a prospective attendee want that session. Before shipping
a title, ask: "would someone sign up because of this line?" Ban dead titles: `Overview`,
`Introduction`, `Demos`, `Basics`, a bare noun, or a title that just repeats the module name.
Prefer specific, evocative titles that name the capability and its payoff, for example
`Building Agents with Custom Tools` over `SDK Demos`, or `Subagents as Subject-Matter Experts`
over `Subagents`.

## One title, three places, always in sync

A topic's display title appears in three files: the master TOC bullet, the topic's own H1, and the
module README's table row. When a topic's content, framing, or name changes, update all three in
the same pass. Changing the topic body without retitling the TOC is the most common miss; changing
one label and not the others leaves the course inconsistent.

## Order to build knowledge

Sequence modules and topics from foundation to application to administration. Teach how to USE a
capability before how to MANAGE or administer it, and build from the simplest case to the most
advanced. Never open a module with its heaviest or most advanced topic; lead with a gentle,
high-engagement starter (delegating to cloud agents is a poor first topic, a subagent or a
read-only research agent is a better one). When the author asks for an order you would not choose,
their sequencing wins.

## One capability, one home

Each capability belongs to exactly one module. Before adding a topic, confirm it does not overlap
another module's territory. Keep a capability map for the course and respect it, for example CI/CD
and infrastructure as code live in the DevOps module, permissions and cost and bring-your-own-key
model routing live in Governance, framework migration lives in the agentic-coding module, and
defining MCP servers and skills lives in the harness or tools module. A topic that duplicates
another module is a signal to pick a different topic, not to add it.

## Size modules so they feel substantial

A module of three or four thin topics reads as weak and unsellable. Aim for roughly five to six
substantive topics per module, and give each topic real depth. When a topic sits at the bare
mechanic level (for example "Subagents" explaining only the delegation UI), flag it and take it
deeper (subagents as subject-matter experts with their own instructions, tools, and model). When a
module is thin, enrich it by adding genuinely distinct topics or by moving a related topic in.

## Do not invent; confirm additions

Use the repo's established or original module and topic names. Never invent a module name or add a
module or topic the author did not ask for. When adding topics to fill out a thin module, propose
the specific topics and confirm the choice before authoring them, because topic selection is the
author's call.

## Structural changes ripple

Renaming, reordering, splitting, or merging a module is never a one-file edit. It requires: renumber
the affected folders with `git mv` to preserve history, fix every internal link that pointed at a
moved path, update the master TOC and the affected module READMEs, and update the schedule table and
the narrative "story" in `demos/readme.md`. After any structural change, verify zero broken relative
links across the tree before reporting done.

Before writing or repointing a cross-module link, confirm the target folder's CURRENT name in the
working tree (glob or `ls`), never the name from the session-start git snapshot: that snapshot is
stale, and a parallel restructure of another module may have already renumbered the folder you are
linking to (for example `01-intro/04-licensing-setup` becoming `05-licensing-setup`). Match links to
the live tree. Leave any unrelated in-progress folder renames untouched; scope your edits to your own
module plus the specific inbound links that point into it.

## Writing style

No em dashes in anything this subskill produces or in this file itself. Use a colon, comma,
semicolon, or parentheses instead.
